1. How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?
	a. Creating a hidden file
		--> touch . (file name)
		--> touch . index.html 

	b. Creating a hidden folder
		--> mkdir . (folder name)
		--> mkdir . assets

	c. Listing hidden files and folders
		   ls -a

2. How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

	~ mkdir -p (folder names, there should be "/" between names)
	~ mkdir -p /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun


3. How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:
first message
second message

	a. Create an empty file(.txt)
		~ touch example.txt

	b.Send a text to the file (">" overwrites the file; because example.txt is empty, below will be the first line)
		~ echo "first message" > example.txt

	c.Append a new text to the file (">>" append the text to the file)
		~ echo "second message" >> example.txt
